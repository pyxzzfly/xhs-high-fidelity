You are a Prompt Engineer. Rewrite the scene description to feature the new product.

=== REFERENCE SCENE (from Step 2) ===
Scene Type: {scene_type}
Scene Description: {scene_description}
Lighting/Style: {lighting_style}

=== NEW PRODUCT ===
{product_desc}

=== REFERENCE SUBJECT (from Step 3 - Layout Analysis) ===
{ref_subject}

=== REFERENCE STYLE (from Step 3 - Layout Analysis) ===
{ref_style}

=== LAYOUT & COMPOSITION ===
{layout_desc}

=== SCALE & PROPORTION ===
{scale_desc}
CRITICAL: The product must remain the dominant focal subject. Follow the scale guidance dynamically by scene, and keep natural perspective with surrounding context.
CRITICAL SINGLE-SUBJECT RULE:
- The generated image must contain EXACTLY ONE main product subject (the new product).
- Do NOT create duplicate/extra products, mirrored copies, multi-pack repetitions, or another competing main subject.
- Do NOT output split-screen/comparison/grid/collage layouts unless explicitly required by the reference layout.
- Supporting elements (hands/props/background objects) are allowed but MUST remain secondary.

=== TASK ===
1. Use the REFERENCE SCENE structure as the base framework
2. Replace the original product with the NEW PRODUCT description
3. Use REFERENCE SUBJECT to understand what to isolate/replace
4. Match REFERENCE STYLE guidance (SEED/COMMERCIAL)
5. Keep the background, lighting, and atmosphere from Scene Description
6. Match the scale guidance from Scale & Proportion
7. Follow the composition from Layout & Composition (Step 3 defines position)
8. TEXTURE INJECTION:
   - If style is "SEED": Add keywords like "film grain, noise, high ISO, phone camera photo, raw candid, slight motion blur, imperfect focus".
   - If style is "COMMERCIAL": Use "sharp focus, 8k, masterpiece".

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
SCENE_TYPE: <refined scene type>
SCENE_DESCRIPTION: <complete scene with new product>
LIGHTING_STYLE: <lighting and style>

You are analyzing a product image to detect the main product region.

The image size is {image_width} x {image_height} pixels.

Task:
1. Identify the main product object.
2. Return a tight bounding box around the product body (exclude large background).
3. Output pixel coordinates within the original image.

Requirements:
- The box must fully contain the entire product body.
- Do not return a partial crop of the product.
- Leave a small margin around the product; avoid cutting off edges.

Output JSON only:
{"product_bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2], "confidence": 0.0}

Notes:
- Use integers.
- x1 < x2, y1 < y2.
